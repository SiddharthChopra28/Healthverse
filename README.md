Simple. Fast. Reliable

Covid cases have been rising exponentially, with about 100,000â€™s of cases being reported daily. To help us monitor these large number of cases, right since the early stages, we made a web application, which tells the user whether he is infected by Covid or not. We do this by analyzing a dataset, training it using machine learning and then predicting the probability of a person being infected by Covid. 
The user can also attach his/her CT scans and X-rays, which can again be used by our app to check whether the person is infected by the virus or not. To do this we used deep learning algorithms on a data frame of confirmed scan images. This in turn formed a mathematical model which is then finally used. 
Using our app, the user can monitor his health easily in day-to-day life. The simple yet efficient user interface enables the person to analyze various health-based parameters, related to Covid, through informative graphs and the log file, that are updated every time the user uses our app.
